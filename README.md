Some experiments to random channels using Slack Webhooks 

## Update
This now supports block-kit messages too. :tada: 


## Setting up 
Please refer slack documentation. (I was too lazy to write for this!)

1. Head over to api.slack.com and craft you Block Kit with the Block Kit Builder: https://api.slack.com/block-kit. Save the output into block.json.
2. Generate your Incoming Webhook via the Slack App Directory: https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks
3. Install required packages and run block-kit.py for block-kit messages and make sure that your block-kit message json is in block.json or just main.py for normal ones.
